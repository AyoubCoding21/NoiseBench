# NoiseBench

NoiseBench is a 2-versions noise algorithm benchmark. It allows PCs to test their sampling performances, It is based off ashima/webgl-noise's benchmark and demo but a bit more intense on their hosts. This project is available for Debian-based Linux PCs only.

# Terms used here

**Noise :** Noise is an algorithm used to generate pseudo-random numbers when the language that you are using does not have truly random numbers.

**Pseudo-random :** Pseudo-random is 50% random, It gives a random feeling but is not truly randomical generation.

# Explanation (Graphics Pros only)

So, how this project works ?
And how can I update some stuff in it ?

Well, The project uses multiple noise algorithms
